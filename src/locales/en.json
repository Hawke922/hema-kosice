    "title": "Košice Fencing Guild",
    "content": "At KŠC, we are dedicated to practicing martial traditions of medieval and Renaissance Europe.

      "header": "What is HEMA?",
      "paragraph": "HEMA, or Historical European Martial Arts, is the modern revival of Europe's forgotten fighting traditions. It's based on historical manuals and brings centuries-old martial traditions back to life through training and sparring"
    },
    "content2": {
      "header": "Not a Stage Combat",
      "paragraph": "Unlike choreographed swordfighting you see in movies or historical events, HEMA is a martial art. Every move is rooted in historical sources and tested against a resisting partner. It's not about performing — it's about understanding how real swordplay works"
    },
    "content3": {
      "header": "Protection for the Modern Duelist",
      "paragraph": "The duels we study were fought in ordinary clothes, not armor, and our gear needs to reflect that. HEMA uses modern protective elements made from puncture-resistant fabrics and durable plastics. It's inspired by history but designed for safety, comfort, and mobility"
    },
    "content4": {
      "header": "The Complete Martial Experience",
      "paragraph": "HEMA offers the full package of a martial art. We train strength, endurance, coordination, and awareness — but also the mindset to push through the limits. Confidence, skill, and friendships are forged through the shared challenge of mastering this complex but rewarding discipline"

    "header": "Our Crew",
    "content": [
      "KŠC kicked off as a small but quickly growing crew led by Slavomír Hubatka back in 2016, training simply out of passion for historical fencing. Unfortunately, pandemic paused our momentum and left us with just a handful of active fencers.",
      "In 2023, with the help of Tomáš Klučár we rebuilt, formalized an official organization and opened up to new members.",
      "While we're still young in the tournament scene, our head coach and founding member, Miroslav Medviď, stands among the world’s top HEMA fencers — a reflection of exceptional commitment to the craft.",
      "Now, with experienced instructors like Filip 'Joxer' Trcka and a growing community of enthusiastic prospects, we're writing the next chapter of our story together."
